## Coding 101

Coding helps us automate tasks. No matter who you are, an engineer, a doctor, a nurse, a teacher, a scientist, a philospher, a home maker, anybody can use coding to do mundane tasks. This helps us be more efficient and frees up our time for something more fun we would rather do.

Fun fact: [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) states that computer power double every two years. Yet we find the computer's today still too slow to do the tasks we want them to perform!

### Functions

A computer program is a set of instructions for the machine to perform. Functions are the building blocks in a computer program. They are like Lego bricks you can use to build something big.

In middle school you might have done functions in Math class. A function is basically a machine that takes some inputs, does some operation on those inputs, and returns some output.

Take the example of a laundry machine. You put dirty clothes in it (the input), you run the machine, and you get clean clothes (the output).

Functions in coding are similar.
